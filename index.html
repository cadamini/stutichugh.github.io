    CLICKBAIT  

    Netflix

    This show was quite a ride! I stumbled upon this Netflix mini series on a rainy weekend which was the perfect timing. The trailer is literally a ‘clickbait’ into the show, which starts with another clickbait-y element, a video of Nick Brewer holding a sign that reads, “at 5 million views I die”. Upon discovering this, Pia, his sister with whom he had a fight the previous night; races to find Nick. The show then does a deep-dive episode on each and every possible suspect that you can think of, that could be related to Nick being missing(or dead?..shhh). Eventually the person responsible ends up being someone you’d have never thought of.

    It is always nice for me to see some brown representation on American television, which in this show was Detective Roshan Amiri. The series shows a glimpse of the immigrant family experience and also shows an almost-romantic relationship between Pia and Detective Amiri that doesn’t go too far, which may be the only thing that disappointed me about this show.

    Without giving too much away…I feel this gif sums up the show…
