	<h3>Hi there, I'm Stuti Chugh!</h3>
	<h3>I'm a traveller, self-proclaimed comedian, and a serial binge-watcher. I ocassionally also end up reading books and I also happen to be working in Data.</h3>
		<h3>This website is mainly created to share my experiences and stories about travelling and living in different countries. I also use this space to share my passion for comedy and TV shows by sharing reviews and recommendations. </h3>
		<h3>Sometimes I may also end up posting some miscelleneous stuff ranging anywhere from mental health to gender equity rants to climate change complaints. We'll see ... </h3>
		<h3>Also even though this a github hosted website this is in no way a space to talk about tech stuff. If you're interested in viewing my academic and professional projects please head over to <a href="https://stuti113.github.io/">this website</a> instead</h3>
