	<h1>Hi there, I'm Stuti Chugh!</h1>
	<p>I'm am a traveller, amateur comedian, and a serial binge-watcher. I ocassionally also end up reading books and I also happen to be working in Data.<br>
		This website is mainly created to share my experiences and stories about travelling to and living in different countries. I also use this space to share my passion for comedy and TV shows by sharing reviews and recommendations. <br>
		Sometimes I may also end up posting some miscelleneous stuff ranging anywhere from mental health to feminist rants to climate change complaints. We'll see. <br>
		Also even though this a github hosted website this is in no way a space to talk about tech stuff. If you're interested in viewing my academic and professional projects please head over to <a href="stuti113.github.io/">this website</a> instead</p>
