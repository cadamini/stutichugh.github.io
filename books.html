Date read: July 2018 <br>
I find it so hard to believe that this was Lapena's suspense debut. It's so good!!! I literally stayed up all night (almost) to finish reading this. I took a 2ish hour nap because I was too tired to continue reading but woke up because my brain refuse to let my body rest without knowing what had to happened that frickin' baby. I have only woken up with this much urgency to study for an exam so that goes on to show how anxious this book made me. Towards the end it does feel like there is a little too much going on with this family and seems to feel a little too unrealistic for me but hey-it's a 'fiction' and 'dramatic' thriller novel. I tried to find out if there is a movie made out of this because the plot is very much great movie material. Just found some fake trailers and a rumored TV series coming out soon based on the movie. We'll see about that... I doubt it will be as thrilling and fun to watch as it was to read this book.

I am not not even that much a reader...until now. This was such a compulsive read. I can't believe that I have spent the past four days obsessing over, wanting to know more and more about a fictional character Zoe/Hillary and her quest to find her birth mother and everything else that unfolded in that process.<br />This was so layered and well written and has successfully turned me into an avid reader who wants to read more and more after having discovered this book. Really gave me Gone Girl vibes! About to start another book by the same author!

Biriyani is a great read! Purna is able to say so much in mere 35 pages even though it requires some time and thought to unpack and appreciate his work. Here are a few of my fav:<br /><br />‘Can we redeem an awkward coffee with another awkward coffee//And pour the remnants of the sweet auras of chalk dusts in a mason jar//Like fireflies and look at them till the day grows dark?// We’ll avoid talking about cotton balls and screeching blackboards // But we’ll talk about how harry met sally //How did he meet her? I never saw the movie // So instead of day dreaming about watching it with you sometime // I will write a sonnet about it and see if it gets published in the New Yorker // and then maybe I will buy you another drink ...” Few lines from ‘Ides of March 2017’ (pg 24-25): “...Safe from the IRS, the ICE, the cops that will probably // beat me up for my skin // And probably deport me and the acorn // To the land I can’t call home // Anymore, // if they ever checked my Facebook posts...”

  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2445665589">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  I really wanted to like this book but unfortunately it didn't really do it for me. Paulo Coelho gained popularity when I was in high school which made me read The Alchemist just like every other kid in my class. And I loved it! 10 years later today I picked up this gem because of its beautiful cover with a redheaded witch. But as they say-don't judge a book by its cover. Call it my cynicism or just skepticism that came with not being in high school anymore, this book felt too preachy, utopian, and imaginary for my taste. I did get mad Wild Wild Country vibes and towards the end of the book I got reminded of the Broad City witches episode from season 4 (more on this coming soon). That along with some quotable quotes Paulo Coelho books always have to offer is why I decided to give it two stars. <br /><br />Here are a couple that made into my quote journal :<br /><br />"Faith is not desire. It is will. Desires are things that need to be satisfied. whereas will is a force. Will changes the space around us."<br /><br />"Everything is worship if your mind is focused on the present moment."
