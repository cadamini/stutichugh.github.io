I find it so hard to believe that this was Lapena's suspense debut. It's so good!!! I literally stayed up all night (almost) to finish reading this. I took a 2ish hour nap because I was too tired to continue reading but woke up because my brain refuse to let my body rest without knowing what had to happened that frickin' baby. I have only woken up with this much urgency to study for an exam so that goes on to show how anxious this book made me. Towards the end it does feel like there is a little too much going on with this family and seems to feel a little too unrealistic for me but hey-it's a 'fiction' and 'dramatic' thriller novel. I tried to find out if there is a movie made out of this because the plot is very much great movie material. Just found some fake trailers and a rumored TV series coming out soon based on the movie. We'll see about that... I doubt it will be as thrilling and fun to watch as it was to read this book.

The trailer made me grab this from the library. I guess so I can also be one of those people who say-‚Äònice movie but the book was betterüòè‚Äô hehe. Nevertheless excited to see this in the theatres when it comes out. Good plot. Without giving out any spoilers I do have to say though it had too many elements of a cliche thriller all thrown in together like they did in pretty little liars but hey, just like I stuck around till the end with PLL, I also read this book till the very end. I don‚Äôt know if it was author‚Äôs intention but I felt that throughout the book the 3 characters were competing for being the most disliked by the reader. For me in the beginning it was Stephanie, halfway through it was Emily, for a minute there towards the end it was Sean. And finally it was none of them I think. I was both impressed by Emily‚Äôs cunning and astute nature but also hated her for her lack of gratitude of her life and other things I won‚Äôt mention to not give any spoilers. I still can‚Äôt figure which emotion was stronger though- being in awe of her wit or dislike for her evil selfishness. Looking forward to watching this movie now.

UPDATE: Did watch the movie. loved it! Liked that they also added some comedic elements to it. Anna Kendrick did a really good job of playing the role of a 'perfect mom'. The soundtrack is pretty good too!
