My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2468982072">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I find it so hard to believe that this was Lapena's suspense debut. It's so good!!! I literally stayed up all night (almost) to finish reading this. I took a 2ish hour nap because I was too tired to continue reading but woke up because my brain refuse to let my body rest without knowing what had to happened that frickin' baby. I have only woken up with this much urgency to study for an exam so that goes on to show how anxious this book made me. Towards the end it does feel like there is a little too much going on with this family and seems to feel a little too unrealistic for me but hey-it's 'fiction' and 'dramatic' thriller novel. I tried to find out if there is a movie made out of this because the plot is very much great movie material. Just found some fake trailers and a rumored TV series coming out soon based on the movie. We'll see about that... I doubt it will be as thrilling and fun to watch as it was to read this book.
