<!-- intro

Missouri is a midwestern state in the US. I came to Missouri in 2012 to attend Truman State University. It was probably the first time I had travelled internationally. It may seem like a just threw a dart on a map while choosing a place to go to study, that happened to have landed on middle-of-no-where liberal arts school in Missouri but it was a thoroughly calculated decison.
Although I didn't know what to expect from it. I am glad I was pleasantly surprised (for the most part)! The next 6 years proved to be the most formative times of my life and I owe it to Truman and Mizzou. -->
