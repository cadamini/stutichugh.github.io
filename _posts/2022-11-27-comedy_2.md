### What's been up in the comedy world?
As you might know I am super passionate about standup comedy. It has helped me so much! See my [**previous post about comedy to understand how**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}).
I know I have been on hiatus from this blog for about a year now so I thought I'll touch base and share my favorites thus far!

### My Top 3 Netflix Specials

###  Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You
![taylor]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/taylorT.jpg)

I used to not like Taylor that much for the longest time as I thought she was a "Christian comic" and that's not my style per se. But then she came up with this new special which was all about mental health and I related so much and laughed SO HARD!!! I also started relating to her Christian stories as well because she talked a lot about forced abstinence and I mentioned struggling with that as well (as an indian girlie) while talking about [**Nikki Glaser**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}#nikki_glaser). Following are my favorite bits from her new special. Some are one-liners, some are funny quotes, some are just setups to a bigger punchline that I'll try not to spoil for ya:

*   The _"pinch the panic attack off like a shit you don’t have time to take"_ bit
*   _“You have trust issue babe... well, YOU have a hot co-worker and a locked phone!!..so”_
*   [on her dad talking about their genetic appearance]_"You and me potato face…these are the cards we were dealt"_
* _"I have never seen a vagina - not even my own, I’m christian"_
* [still talking about her vagina]_"Actually that’s where I think I keep the bipolar, actually if you find some could you like scrape it out? Just like a mental health Pap smear?"_
*_“Women are surprised when they find someone who can make them cum, men are surprised when they find someone who can make them feel genuine feelings”_
*[suicide hotline hangup]_"Did this bitch just ghost me when I am trying to ghost myself"_
*_"Do you know hoe embarrassing it is to have your first orgasm from another person? Its like a realtor showing you your own house."_

_“A second bathroom?! You have not seen this place? You lived here for NINETEEN YEARS!!”_

_“Yeah well I’m just renting it from the guy upstairs, if I flood it I don’t get my security deposit back”_

### Neal Brennan: Blocks

![neal blocks]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/nealbrennanblocks.jpg)

Neal has done it again! The new special Blocks is just as good(if not better) than the _3 Mics_. First of all it has a very beautiful opening soundtrack and the show closes on the same melody. There are themes of mental health, race, political satire, and so much more! Its another masterpiece! The only weird thing was that there was not much 'buzz' about it for some reason. Even after checking a few days after the release I could only find 50 tweets about it and 10 articles. I guess some artists are just super underrated. And in similar fashion here are the my favorite bits:

* [perfect self-deprecating opener]_"Is your life going smoothly? Are you just floating from event to event…because I am NOT!”_

* [on people pleasing/paranoia] _“I worry that my final thought on my death bed is going to be?’…..is that nurse mad at me? BEEEEEEP *dies*_

* _"No dog is thriving on their own, they are all rescue. This doesn’t happen- 'hey, how did your met your dog?' - 'Went to the bank of America- she was the manager! Now she’s our full time labradoodle'"_

* _"Chair drop- transgender -jenga"_ bit

* _"One day I got home … I got an email… paper email…a letter, we’ll call it"_

* _“How! Liberal! Are! You!?”_ - game show bit

* [on Kanye]_"Since when did we rely on rappers for their emotional stability"_

* [gun control & mental health] _"sir, before we sell you this gun, can we look at your browser history, please?... Sir, you have been listening to Lena Del Ray! And have been staring at pictures of your ex. ... Sir, we are not going to give you a gun today but we ARE gonna give you a bag of mushrooms and a copy of Ace Venture: Pet Detective"_

* [Statistics about divorce/relationship success rate] _"there is 1/8 chance we'll marry the person we date. and marriage success rate is 50%. So there's really only 6% chance of lifelong relationship."_

* _"Making donations to the anti-capitalist group"_ bit

* [On weed] _"is weed supposed to make you violently high for 5 minus and then you gotta go to sleep? Is that weed? Cause in that case, bull’s eye."_

* _"Both my parents were born in the Great Depression…and they were nice enough to bring it with them"_

* _"Aethism is height of white previlige; 'Hey can we interest you in an afterlife?' - 'oh no-thank you'”_

* _"Never been married. Never had kids. People don’t like it. People don’t even pity you. They are suspicious. I would get more trust from women if I’d been married and murdered my wife. They’d be like -“he’s capable of love. He just gets *too passionate*""_

* _Relationships are daily trust falls_ bit

* _"I’m not gay but I have experienced a ton of homophobia …because I have a bidet"_

* [Men/Women nicknames] _"the is my friend barren Sarah … she so dry down there we call her… Sahara"_

* _"To me, having a kid  rn would be like - you’re at a house party, its packed with people, you can’t move, roof’s on fire, basement’s flooding, cops are coming, and you look at your friend and you’re like -“we should invite Brian”"_

* _"Saying on first dates, I don’t want kids is like saying in a job interview- just so you know, I don’t fuck with computers”_
