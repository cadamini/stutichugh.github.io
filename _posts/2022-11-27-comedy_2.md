### What's been up in the comedy world?
As you might know I am super passionate about standup comedy. It has helped me so much! See my [**previous post about comedy**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %})). But I have been on hiatus from this blog for about a year now so I thought I'll touch base and share my favorites thus far.

### My Top Favorites Specials

###  Taylor Tomlinson: Look at You

I used to not like Taylor that much because for the longest time I thought she was a "Christian comic". But then she came up with this new special which was all about mental health and I related so much and laughed SO HARD!!! I also started relating to her 'Christian' stories as well because she talked a lot about forced celibacy and I mentioned struggling with that as well (as a brown girlie) while talking about [**Nikki Glaser**]({% post_url 2021-09-15-comedy %}#nikki_glaser)). Following are my favorite bits from her new special. Some are one-liners, some are funny quotes, some are just setups to a bigger punchline that I'll try not to spoil for ya:

*   The _"pinch the panic attack off like a shit you don’t have time to take"_ bit
*   _“You have trust issue babe.. well, YOU have a hot co-worker and a locked phone!!..so”_
*   [on her dad talking about their genetic appearance]_"You and me potato face…these are the cards we were dealt"_
* The _Men are lecherous creeps_ bit

I also got to see Neal live at Clusterfest and he had a pretty good set.  
My second favorite work by Neal is his podcast [**How Neal Feel** ](https://open.spotify.com/show/6ubzqFvDN5wUmsUH5DRJVw?si=XyvViim-Q7GpY8CwHJnk3g&dl_branch=1)which he co-hosts with his bud Bianca Sia. They talk a lot about race, current events, and also answer fan questons.  
I am drawn to this podcast because Neal indulges in some really intelligent banter with Bianca which is refreshing and entertaining. The podcast is on hiatus right now because Neal is filming his second comedy special called _UNACCEPTABLE_ (Can't wait for it to be on Netflix!)

### Nikki Glaser

Nikki is not only my favorite comedian but also my favorite person lol (atleast for now!). She's funny, smart, talented, witty, and gorgeous. She isn't afraid to show vulnerability or be self-deprecating.  
I also think I am drawn to her because she is very outspoken, especially about sex and mental health. Both of these topics are a big taboo in the culture I was raised in, so getting to see a woman who he is really not afraid to talk about hilariously graphic deets of her sex life on stage is impressive to me.  
You can find that to be true in her Netflix Special _Bangin_ and in her other comedy sets. She also KILLS it on all of the Comedy Central Roasts she has been a part of. I am an avid listener of her podcast. Initially it was [**You Up with Nikki Glazer**](https://open.spotify.com/show/7F3wZHsBYp3gnRnDPRXW0o?si=XT7M92eSStitcCEKIegBEA&dl_branch=1) but that ended and now I catch up on her on [**The Nikki Glaser Podcast**](https://open.spotify.com/show/4LnlzXj1jT5pDebflpwQtH?si=j4WTlu9GRfCgpLNdEFngUg&dl_branch=1)  
Nikki discusses her week including comedy gigs she's on. They do a news segment, a _why do I care_ segment where they discuss 'news' that really shoudln't be news but it is, so why not discuss it and roast it, right? lol. Then there's a fanthrax which is just fan questions amd reddit dumps. Nikki has a wonderful opener named Andrew Collin, who is also her best friend and roommate atm. Andrew's laugh is contagious on this show. They make a pretty cool comedy duo.  
I got a chance to meet Nikki (and Andrew) at the San Jose Improv.

It was a great time! Nikki brought in another opener named Emil Wakim who also did a pretty good job of warming up the crowd.  
If you're not into super raunchy stuff, Nikki may not be for you. But if you listen to her podcasts you may realize there is a lot more to her than just sex talk.  
[**This**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=17UsmVOL6X0&t=98s&ab_channel=YouUpwithNikkiGlaser) is one of my favorite episodes of the You Up podcast where Nikki shares an awful date story with Moshe Kasher and Natasha Leggero(also two great comedians)  

### Other Favorites

Other than my top 2, I also enjoy Mark Normand, Hasan Minhaj, Dave Chappelle, Pete Davidson, Michelle Wolf, Amy Schumer, Michael Che, Andrew Schulz, and many more
