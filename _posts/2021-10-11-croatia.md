Croatia's a beauitful country in the Balkan Peninsula. Although It was primarily a work trip each time, I still managed to walk arounf and experience much of Zagreb past 6pm and during the weekends.

My favorite time to go to Croatia was during Advent (~ time around Christmans). Advent markets are reallly pretty. There's mulled wine everywhere.

The city feels magical during winter time.


#### A day in the life of a professional on a work trip in croatiaintro

Aside from the advent week, I had made some trips during regulat times as well, which were just as fun. Our day started with walking from our airbnb to the office building. We used to grab a strudel or something from a Bakery on our way to the office.

Post morning work and meetings we had lunch, usually at this place that serves copious amounts of meat. Meat is everywhere! lol. It's heard to be a vegetarian in Zagreb but I did have a vegan coworker who practised yoga, which brings to the things I did post-work

Post a sesh at this place we usually went to get some **Cevapi** which is a Balkan staple or go for something fancier like this restaurant:
