Croatia's a beauitful country in the Balkan Peninsula. Although It was primrily a work trip each time, I still managed to walk arounf and experience much of Zagreb past 6pm and during the weekends.

My favorite time to go to Croatia was during Advent ~ time around Christmans. Advent markets are reallly pretty. There's mulled wine everywhere.
