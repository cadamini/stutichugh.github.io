Going away for a while has been on my mind since the beginning of this year. My 30th birthday(the big 3-0, as they say) seems a fitting time to make such a trip. I decided to book a solo trip for Serbia as a self-appreciation gift a month-ish ago to celebrate the end of my 20s and to welcome a new era, that is the 30s.
