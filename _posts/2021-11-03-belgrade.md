Going away for a while has been on my mind since the beginning of this year. My 30th birthday(the big 3-0, as they say) seems a fitting time to make such a trip. I decided to book a solo trip for Serbia as a self-appreciations gift a month-ish ago to celebrate the end of my 20s and to begin a new era that is the 30s.

Serbia, although chosen based on process of elimination (can talk more on this if you DM me), proved to be a beautiful new country to explore.  It reminded me of my times in Croatia, especially with all the Cevapi and Rakiya; but had a charm of its own.
