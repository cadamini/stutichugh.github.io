Going away for a while has been on my mind since the beginning of this year. My 30th birthday(the big 3-0, as they say) seemed a fitting time to make such a trip. I decided to book a solo trip for Serbia as a self-appreciation gift a month-ish ago to celebrate the end of my 20s and to welcome a new era, that is the 30s.

#### Best spots in Belgrade

- **Belgrade Fortress**

  This was one of my favorite touristy things to do in Belgrade. It is kind of a long walk from the nearest bus station but its worth the hype as it offers such a great view of the sunset over the river. I ended up going there twice during my trip. There are a couple souvenir shops that also sell snacks and drinks. There are many park style benches where you can people watch and enjoy the view over a drink.

- **Saint Sava Temple**

  The church of St. Sava is the largest church in the Balkans and also one of the largest in the world! It is a mesmerizing piece of architecture that is stunning to observe. The Cathedral has very beautiful interior and a calm atmosphere.

  This hashtag Beograd sign was on my way to the Cathedral.

#### Where to live and how to get around

  If you're traveling solo (and/or are an extrovert) it is recommended that you live in a hostel. It is easier to meet people and make friends to go do touristy things as a group. In my case, I really wanted to enjoy, understand, and embrace solitude and have time to self-reflect and resurrect my self-sufficient streak (after having lived with my parents for the past ~1.5 years), so I decided to stay by myself in an airbnb. Although challenging, there is nothing more freeing and badass than living and exploring a foreign country on your own, making your own schedule, and having a lot of time to journal and self-reflect through the trip.

  [This](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/37154194?source_impression_id=p3_1635786880_7zGK3Eewbk5WBRwm&guests=1&adults=1) is the airbnb I chose. It had a grocery store, a bus stop, and a decent collection of restaurants nearby. The host Dubravka is very helpful and responsive and speaks good english. The studio is great for solo travelers but can also accommodate couples and 3 people(if one is willing to sleep on the couch). There is a beautiful patio to enjoy the view over drinks or a meal. The studio also comes equipped with a full kitchen which was an important factor for me as I like at-least one of my 3 meals to be home cooked during vacations.

  Best way to get around is through public transport aka buses. Make sure you choose a place that has a bus stop nearby. You need to get a bus pass to be able to ride the bus. Make sure you know how much money you have left on your card at all times and understand the pass rules as you can be fined 5000 RSD if you don't have enough money/miles left on your card and are found to be riding the bus.

  There is a no Uber or Uber like service in Serbia(big bummer for me!) and if you miss a bus you will have to call a taxi service. Pink Taxi and Lux Taxi are the ones I used a few times.
