<!-- intro

My first time in the Bay was when I came to do an internship at Girls Who Code. Prior to moving there I thought I wouldn't like it there given how its known for tech and I was already oversaturated by that having lived in India my whole life. It may seem counterintuitve that I dislike the tech crowd yet choose to intern at GWC.
Its just that I chose GWC because it works towards closing the gender gap in technology. The <i>"gender" gap </i> part of it is what got to me and prompted me to apply. And I'm glad it did! Bay Area has SO MUCH more to offer than what I thought. There is a lot of art and culture to be explored and the FOOD IS AMAZING!!! You could be one of those people who exclusively hangs with other people in tech but the city has ALL KINDS OF PEOPLE, to my surprise. I also really appreciated the diversity I experienced in a way I hadn't before. I had lived in Atlanta for a bit and Missouri and both also had people of multiple races but it seemed like in these places each racial group kinda kept to themselves for the most part; as opposed to the Bay Area where people of all races mingled with each other and wanted to be friends with international students/expats like me. This could just be my experience and I do know people who still live in their own-ethnicity-bubble in the Bay Area, but I feel chances of that happening are less in San Francisco as opposed to middle America or South. -->
