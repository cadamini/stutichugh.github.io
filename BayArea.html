<p>  My first time in the Bay was when I came to do an internship at <a href="https://girlswhocode.com"><b>Girls Who Code</b></a>. Prior to moving there I thought I wouldn't like it there, given how its known for being an extremely tech oriented place and I was already oversaturated by that having lived in India my whole life. It may seem counterintuitve that I dislike the tech crowd yet choose to intern at GWC.
  Its just that I chose GWC because it works towards closing the gender gap in technology. The <i>gender</i> gap part of it is what got to me and prompted me to apply. And I'm glad it did!</p>

  <p>Bay Area has SO MUCH more to offer than what I thought. There is a lot of art and culture to be explored in the city and the FOOD IS AMAZING!!! And there are all kinds of people there (aside from tech)! I mean sure, you'll end up hearing the words <i> IPO </i> and <i> Equity </i> more often than you'd like but still, I really appreciated the diversity I experienced in a way I hadn't before. I had lived in Atlanta for a bit and Missouri for a while. Both of those places also had people of multiple races but it seemed like in these places each racial group kinda kept to themselves for the most part; as opposed to the Bay Area where people of all races mingled with each other and locals/Americans were more open to being friends with international students/expats.
  <br>This could just be my experience and I do know people who live in their own-ethnicity-bubble even in the Bay Area, but I feel chances of that happening are less in San Francisco as opposed to middle America or the South.<br>
  At the end of the day <i>Your vibe attracts your tribe</i>.

<h3 style="color: #cc8899;">Favorite Food and Drink Places</h3>

<p> As I said, my favorite thing about The Bay is the diversity, which applies to food as well. You can get good, (almost) authentic food for almost every cuisine you can think of.
    Here are some of my favorites and the best places to get them.
